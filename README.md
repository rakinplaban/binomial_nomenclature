# Binomial Nomencleture

In taxonomy, ***Binomial Nomenclature*** ("two-term naming system"), also called **binary nomenclature**, is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just "binomial"), a binomen, binominal name, or a scientific name; more informally it is also historically called a Latin name. In the [ICZN](https://www.iczn.org/), the system is also called binominal nomenclature,[1] "binomi'N'al" with an "N" before the "al", which is not a typographic error, meaning "two-name naming system"
